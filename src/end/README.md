# The End

Congratulations! 🏆

You've reached the end of the **Zero to React with Hooks** minishop, learning about JSX, `useState`, `useEffect`, lists, and so much more! You now have the tools to start building new React apps using hooks.

Hopefully, you'll get to apply this learning right away at your job or in a side project. But if not, I suggest you **come back to this minishop in a week or two** and review the content. You can finish up some exercises, try your hand at some of the bonuses, or test your understanding with the [quiz](../quiz/). Your brain likes to garbage collect unused knowledge and we want this to stick around! The Github repo is public for you to review.
