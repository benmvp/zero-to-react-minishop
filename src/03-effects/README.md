# Step 3 - Effects

Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of _side effects_. They are not part of the main render loop of a component, but are very common in React components.

üèÖ The goal of this step is to learn how to use the `useEffect` hook for managing side effects.

If you didn't successfully complete the previous step, that's okay! The steps are meant to push you. üòÑ

However, you may find yourself in a position where you app is not compiling, and it's preventing you from working on this step. No problem! Stash your changes **in a new terminal window**, and you should be good to continue:

```sh
git stash push -m "In-progress Step 2 exercises"
```

Your app should automatically reset and you should be able to continue on with the current step.

## ‚≠ê Concepts

- Handling effects with and without cleanup using `useEffect`
- Optimizing `useEffect` performance by skipping redundant effects
- Making API calls with the `useEffect` hook

## üí° Exercises

In [`App.js`](./App.js), use the `useEffect` hook to make an API request for Giphy results whenever the query changes and update the new `results` state with the API response.

> NOTE: The API results are only logged to the console for now. We will render the results in [Step 4](../04-lists/).

(If at any point you get stuck, you can take a peek at the [answers](./answers/App.js))

## ü§ì Bonus!

### 1. Polling

Add polling to `GiphySearch` such that it will continually retrieve new Giphy results after a configurable amount of seconds. Add a `pollInterval` prop to `GiphySearch` and set it to 5 seconds in `App`. Verify that if you change `pollInterval` in the React Developer Tools the previous interval is cleaned up and a new one is created.

### 2. Async `useEffect`

Use an `async` function for the call to `await getResults()` within `useEffect()` instead of calling `.then()` on its return Promise value.

üîë _HINT:_ Remember that an `async` function **always** returns a `Promise`, but the only return value allowed for `useEffect()` is the cleanup function callback.

## üß† Elaboration & Feedback

After you're done with the exercise and before jumping to the next step, please fill out the [elaboration & feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScRocWvtbrl4XmT5_NRiE8bSK3CMZil-ZQByBAt8lpsurcRmw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.1671251225=Zero+to+React+with+Hooks+Minishop&entry.1984987236=Step+3+-+Effects). It will help seal in what you've learned.
